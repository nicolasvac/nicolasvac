## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nicolas Vaccari and I am a skilled computer scientist with over 5+ years of professional experience in the IT world, able to perform effectively in all types of work environments.

I work closely with all parts of the IT world, from software design to its implementation on production infrastructure.

My current work focus is technology research and development, with a particular attention to GitOps, DevOps and dynamically scalable infrastructures with Kubernetes.

You wont find much here, as i have a separate work github account which is where i mostly code, and my personal projects are mostly private, but feel free to look in to what is public!

You can reach me out on my personal website or my linkedin profile, both linked in the social sidebar on this github profile.

Thanks for the visit!
